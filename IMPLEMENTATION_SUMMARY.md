## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1. Polymarket API Integration

The `PolymarketClient` class provides a comprehensive interface to the Polymarket Gamma API:

**Key Features:**
- Fetch markets with filtering by search query, liquidity, and price
- Parse market data including prices, outcomes, and metadata
- Search for weather-specific markets by city
- Fetch order book data for market analysis

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /markets` - Fetch list of markets
- `GET /markets/{id}` - Fetch specific market details
- `GET /order-book/{market_id}` - Fetch order book data

**Example Usage:**
```python
client = PolymarketClient()
markets = await client.search_weather_markets(
    cities=["London", "New York", "Seoul"],
    min_liquidity=50.0,
    max_price=0.10
)
```

### 2.2. Tomorrow.io Weather API Integration

The `WeatherClient` class integrates with Tomorrow.io's weather API:

**Key Features:**
- Fetch weather forecasts for multiple cities
- Calculate temperature probabilities with ±3.5°F deviation
- Map weather codes to human-readable conditions
- Support for 8 major cities (London, New York, Seoul, Tokyo, Paris, Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai)

**Probability Calculation:**
The strategy uses a sophisticated probability calculation based on temperature deviation:
- Within ±3.5°F: Linear interpolation from 1.0 to 0.5
- Beyond ±3.5°F: Exponential decay

**Example Usage:**
```python
client = WeatherClient(api_key="your_key")
forecast = await client.get_forecast("London")
probability = client.calculate_probability(
    actual_temp=70.0,
    target_temp=75.0,
    deviation=3.5
)
```

### 2.3. Trading Strategy Engine

The `TradingStrategy` class implements the core trading logic:

**Strategy Parameters:**
- **Min Liquidity:** $50.00 (minimum market liquidity)
- **Min Edge:** 15% (minimum edge percentage to trade)
- **Max Price:** $0.10 (maximum YES token price)
- **Min Confidence:** 60% (minimum confidence threshold)

**Signal Generation:**
The strategy generates four types of signals:
1. **BUY** - Market is undervalued (positive edge ≥ 15%)
2. **SELL** - Market is overvalued (negative edge ≤ -15%)
3. **HOLD** - Edge is insufficient or confidence is low
4. **SKIP** - Market doesn't meet minimum criteria

**Edge Calculation:**
```
Edge = (Fair Price - Market Price) / Market Price
```

**Confidence Scoring:**
Confidence is calculated based on:
- Edge magnitude (30% weight)
- Liquidity level (20% weight)
- Price stability (10% weight)
- Fair price reasonableness (10% weight)
- Base confidence (30%)

### 2.4. Portfolio Simulator

The `PortfolioSimulator` class simulates trading performance:

**Features:**
- Track capital allocation across trades
- Calculate profit/loss for each trade
- Maintain cumulative ROI
- Generate portfolio summary statistics

**Trade Execution:**
```python
simulator = PortfolioSimulator(initial_capital=197.0)
result = simulator.execute_trade(opportunity, amount=100.0)
```
